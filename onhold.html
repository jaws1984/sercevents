		<h2>The Wilson Reading System&reg;: Introductory Workshop</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 15, 2016</h3>
		<p>The Wilson Reading System® (WRS) is a structured literacy program based on phonological-coding research and Orton-Gillingham principles that directly and systematically teach the structure of the English language to students in grade 2-12 who require intensive reading intervention, including students with specific learning disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia. This three-day professional learning opportunity introduces educators to the Wilson Reading System methodology and provides instruction on planning and delivering reading lessons; modeling and feedback from a credentialed Wilson trainer will be provided during the workshop. Educators who complete this three-day training will be eligible to continue the professional learning required to receive a Wilson Level I certification.</p>
		<p>Materials, including an instructor manual and an extensive collection of controlled texts, are included in the cost of this professional learning opportunity.</p>
		<p>Participants completing this professional learning opportunity will summarize the research base and component skills of structured reading instruction; describe the learning profiles of students with reading difficulties, including specific learning disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia; identify students appropriate for placement in the Wilson Reading System (WRS); explain the WRS instructional methodology; and prepare a ten-part WRS lesson plan.</p>
		<p>Educators prepared to commit to completing a year-long Level I Wilson Reading System training 2017-18 can apply to become part of a Connecticut-based learning cohort. Email Donna Merritt at merritt@ctserc.org for more information.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>
		<p><strong>Multi-day Event: </strong>11/15/2016, 11/16/2016, 11/17/2016</p>

		<h2>Fundations&reg; Level I: Kindergarten</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">December 9, 2016</h3>
		<p>Wilson Fundations&reg; is a research-based program of systematic and explicit literacy instruction that supports the prevention of reading and spelling difficulties through "core" (Tier 1) instruction and the provision of early intervening services (Tier 2).

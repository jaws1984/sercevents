		<h2>Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain: Promoting Authentic Engagement and Rigor Among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">October 20, 2016</h3>
		<p>We know that students learning English face two sets of demands: to learn the content and to learn English at the same time. This requires strategies that will allow them to access the skills and concepts needed to comprehend academic content as their proficiency in English grows.</p>
		<p>This session examines teaching and learning activities that can support students learning English in acquiring academic language while increasing comprehension of subject-area content. The strategies in this session will also be beneficial for students with language-based learning disabilities.</p>
		<p>Participants will draft teaching and learning activities that will support students learning English in their content area, identifying skills and strategies that can translate into their classroom practice.</p>

		<h2>Building District Capacity to Conduct Comprehensive Evaluations for Students Suspected of Having Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 2, 2016</h3>
		<p>Special education directors and supervisors of special education are invited to self-examine their district capacity to evaluate the phonological processing skills and language-literacy needs of students suspected of having specific learning disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia. In this job-embedded professional learning opportunity, they will apply the content of Connecticut’s Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia Assessment Guide (CSDE/SERC, 2016) within the framework of comprehensive evaluations detailed in Connecticut’s Guidelines for Identifying Children with Learning Disabilities (2010). Participants will review the components of reading, spelling, and oral language essential to the identification of SLD/Dyslexia and engage in a structured facilitated process, examining their district’s capacity to support the comprehensive evaluation process.</p>
		<p>Administrators and supervisors completing this professional learning opportunity will summarize the component reading, spelling, and oral language skills essential to reading, spelling, and written language; self-examine the collective expertise of their educators to conduct comprehensive evaluations to identify SLD/Dyslexia; and create a focused action plan that addresses systemic gaps.</p>

		<h2>Transition Planning: Connecting the Pieces of the Secondary Transition Process</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 1, 2016</h3>
		<p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA 2004) mandates that secondary transition services be designed to encompass both academic achievement and functional performance that facilitates movement from school to post-school activities for EACH student with a disability. The State Performance Plan (SPP) Indicator 13 specifies that these requirements be addressed in a student’s individualized education program (IEP).</p>
		<p>During this professional learning activity, participants will utilize various transition tools to review their current practices regarding secondary transition planning and the requirements to meet the needs of all students. They will focus on the alignment of the various pieces of the IEP and reflect on how they have gone "Above and Beyond Compliance." This will allow participants to "piece the puzzle together" to ensure quality Secondary Transition supports and services.</p>
		<p>SERC will provide each district participating in these sessions with yearlong support through online training modules of instruction and the development of a Professional Learning Network over Schoology. Districts will also receive a transition resource book to support secondary transition programming.</p> 
		<p>Participating districts interested in on-site technical assistance may contract with SERC for additional services during the 2016-2017 school year.</p>

		<h2>Using Technology and Interactive Tools to Enhance Literacy Learning in the Preschool and Kindergarten Classroom</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 16, 2016</h3>
		<p>Early childhood educators may look to technology as a tool to enhance development of children from diverse learning backgrounds. However, choosing and learning about the vast amount of new technologies appropriate for the preschool and kindergarten classroom can be a challenging undertaking.</p>
		<p>This beginner’s technology session will help early childhood professionals navigate how to use technology to support literacy learning. The session includes an overview of play, communication, and literacy development of children with and without significant disabilities; an overview of assistive technology for young children and a demonstration of low-, mid-, and high-tech tools; developmentally appropriate practices in using technology, including assistive technology, iPad apps, and other tools that support literacy development; and hands-on experiences to create adapted materials to enhance the play, communication, and literacy skills of children with developmental disabilities.</p>

		<h2>Introduction to Restorative Practices</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 17, 2016</h3>
		<p>Restorative Practices, inspired by the philosophy of restorative justice, are used to build community and respond to challenging behavior through authentic dialogue, coming to understanding, and making things right [International Institute for Restorative Practices website, 2013]. Schools that use Restorative Practices have a flexible approach to school policies and practices when managing challenging behavior.</p>
		<p>This training will offer participants the opportunity to understand Restorative Practices as a more flexible school-wide approach to discipline. It will cover the core values, principles, and goals of Restorative Practices; provide an overview of various models and components; and identify stakeholders in the Restorative Practices process. As a result of this training, participants will better understand the necessary resources for implementing Restorative Practices in schools, including implementation within a multi-tiered system of support.</p>

		<h2>Making Early Literacy FUNTASTIC for Infants and Toddlers</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 1, 2016</h3>
		<p>Engaging infants and toddlers in early literacy activities will give them a great start to using new skills:  play, communication and socialization with others, language and vocabulary, and early reading.  We now know that enriched early experiences that include intentional positive interaction, meaningful talk, and opportunities to play and manipulate objects and toys are critical while young brains are developing.</p>
		<p>The primary outcome of this professional learning opportunity is building early literacy learning for infants and toddlers that is "Funtastic." For early childhood professionals, this includes developmentally appropriate practice in planning safe, engaging, creative environments and materials; creating learning activities to meet the needs of diverse learners of all abilities; learning how to embed Funtastic literacy activities in daily routines using an ecological inventory; and supporting families to use routines at home for early literacy learning.</p>

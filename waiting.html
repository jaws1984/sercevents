		<h2>Transition Planning: Connecting the Pieces of the Secondary Transition Process</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 1, 2016</h3>
		<p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA 2004) mandates that secondary transition services be designed to encompass both academic achievement and functional performance that facilitates movement from school to post-school activities for EACH student with a disability. The State Performance Plan (SPP) Indicator 13 specifies that these requirements be addressed in a studentâ€™s individualized education program (IEP).</p>
		<p>During this professional learning activity, participants will utilize various transition tools to review their current practices regarding secondary transition planning and the requirements to meet the needs of all students. They will focus on the alignment of the various pieces of the IEP and reflect on how they have gone "Above and Beyond Compliance." This will allow participants to "piece the puzzle together" to ensure quality Secondary Transition supports and services.</p>
		<p>SERC will provide each district participating in these sessions with yearlong support through online training modules of instruction and the development of a Professional Learning Network over Schoology. Districts will also receive a transition resource book to support secondary transition programming.</p> 
		<p>Participating districts interested in on-site technical assistance may contract with SERC for additional services during the 2016-2017 school year.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

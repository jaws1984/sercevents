		<h2>SLD/Dyslexia: Connecting Research to Practice in Connecticut</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">October 1, 2016</h3>
		<p>This advanced-level 12-hour professional learning opportunity is a comprehensive series of web-based learning modules that address the foundations of reading acquisition, identification of SLD/Dyslexia, and evidence-based instructional practices. The modules are suitable for educators with a broad understanding of SLD/Dyslexia (including general and special education teachers, student support services professionals, literacy specialists, and administrators) who are seeking to expand their knowledge base by examining seminal research and applying it to changes in their work with students.</p>
		<p>In this training, Connecticut content experts and educational leaders synthesize research on reading and language development, subtypes of reading difficulties, implementation of core literacy instruction, assessment of SLD/Dyslexia, and the components of structured literacy instruction, including spelling and written expression. Each of the content-based modules are followed by reflection segments, content questions, and professional dialogue led by a literacy expert and a district professional to guide educators through the process of examining and altering current SLD/Dyslexia practices. </p>
		<p>Participants completing this online course will: explain the domains of oral language and the components of reading and how they intersect; describe how a multi-tiered system of support (MTSS) is essential in providing tiers of intervention for students having difficulty learning to read, beginning with comprehensive “core” literacy instruction in general education; differentiate between the distinct types of reading difficulties students can experience, including SLD/Dyslexia; outline the elements of a comprehensive special education evaluation when SLD/Dyslexia is suspected; and summarize the structured literacy instruction that students with various profiles of reading difficulty need, including students with SLD/Dyslexia.</p>

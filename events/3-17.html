		<h2>What Is Assistive Technology (AT) and How Can It Help My Child? - Elementary - Session B (In Spanish)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 7, 2017</h3>
		<p>If you are a parent of a middle or high school student with special needs, you have likely heard the term "assistive technology" or "AT," but you might not be familiar with exactly what that means or how it can enhance your child's learning in school, at home, or in the community.  In this session, parents/guardians will learn about the scope and functions of AT, and actually handle many of the low-, mid-, and high-tech devices (from SERC's AT Corner in the SERC Library) that can enhance student learning.</p>
		<p>Participants will have the opportunity to share their questions and experiences with other families participating in the session. Parents will discover how they and the rest of the Planning and Placement Team can determine their child’s need for AT; how to choose AT devices and systems that would make a positive difference in their child’s learning; how to advocate for providing their child with an AT device or product he or she needs; the child’s legal right to AT equipment; and how AT can help a student achieve Secondary Transition goals and objectives.</p>
		<p>This session is a collaboration among SERC, the CT Parent Information and Resource Center (CT PIRC), and the Connecticut Parent Advocacy Center (CPAC).</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>5:30 p.m.</p>

		<h2>Differentiating Speech-Language Impairment from Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 14, 2017</h3>
		<p>The appropriate identification of SLD/Dyslexia in the elementary grades requires the input of speech and language pathologists (SLPs) who can offer planning and placement teams (PPTs) essential information about a student’s phonological processing and support differentiating a reading disability from a generalized speech-language impairment (SLI).</p>
		<p>On Day 1 of this professional learning opportunity, participants will review foundational information about SLD/Dyslexia, including its neurobiological basis, and will compare student data profiles consistent with this disability category in contrast to SLI. On Day 2, participants will bring their own student data (with confidential information redacted) and engage in facilitated group discussions about evaluation results and eligibility determination. On both days, participants will also have opportunities to interact with the extensive collection of special education assessments in SERC’s library.</p>
		<p>Speech and language pathologists completing this professional learning opportunity will illustrate the interactive processing systems underlying reading comprehension; explain the profiles of students with reading and oral language difficulties; map comprehensive assessment results to profiles of reading and oral language difficulties; and differentiate SLI from SLD/Dyslexia.</p>

		<h2>Proud to Be Me, &amp; other Social Studies Themes in Early Childhood to Promote Positive Self Image</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 23, 2017</h3>
		<p>Positive self-image fosters achievement in all learners, especially students of color.  Families often socialize their children in ways that promote racial and ethnic pride, high expectations for learning, and positive behavior.  As educators serve the increasingly diverse needs of children and families, they must be prepared to support children’s growing curiosity about themselves, other people, and the communities in which they live and learn.</p>
		<p>Even in early childhood settings, learning about social studies can build on the family’s contribution to their child’s development of self-image. This two-day professional learning opportunity provides support and time for early childhood professionals developing social studies units for preschool and kindergarten children.</p>
		<p>Participants will learn about understanding and supporting positive self-image and identity and the role of family for all children; how to implement equitable learning and anti-bias education; and opportunities to develop a social studies curriculum and units of study using the CT Early Learning and Development Standards.</p>
		<p>Each participant is asked to bring lesson plan templates and/or a non-fiction or fiction picture book they wish to incorporate into the social studies unit they seek to create.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

		<h2>Designing General Education Behavior Support Plans: A Practitioners Guide</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 29, 2017</h3>
		<p>In this session, school administration and staff will learn about systems and structures that aid in supporting students’ behavioral, social-emotional, and mental health needs. Participants will learn best practices for designing general education behavior support plans using their framework of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS).</p>
		<p>As participants learn more about the function-based behavior process for students, they will better understand the motivation, pay-off, or function of a student’s problem behavior. They will then use that information to identify and implement effective interventions to include in behavior intervention plans (BIPs), as part of their tiered supports.</p>

		<h2>PPT Chairperson Training (Spring Session)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 30, 2017</h3>
		<p>The Planning and Placement Team (PPT) chairperson works as part of the team to develop IEPs for students with disabilities that provide access and opportunities for meaningful participation and progress in the general education curriculum. Within schools, the PPT chairperson should ensure that the compliance requirements of the PPT process are met, that assessment data and goals and objectives are directly linked to the general education curriculum, and that placement decision-making occurs after the goals and objectives are developed.</p>
		<p>Participants in this professional learning activity will receive an overview of the rationale for the legal requirements of an individualized education program (IEP); develop in-depth knowledge about the PPT process and how it is to be properly documented; examine quality and compliance indicators of the components of the PPT process; learn how to foster culturally relevant family engagement; and examine/practice strategies for facilitating effective PPT meetings.</p>

		<h2>Tier 1 Classroom Behavior Management Strategies</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 1, 2017</h3>
		<p>A primary responsibility of teachers is to help students learn, but learning can be difficult in chaotic environments. Sometimes teachers are challenged daily to create and maintain a positive, productive classroom atmosphere conducive to learning. In the process, teachers might make common classroom behavior management mistakes.</p>
		
		<p>With this professional learning opportunity, teachers will better understand their role in preventing and responding to behavior through a Tier 1 approach.  It will cover the 10 evidence-based strategies in proactive behavior management in a flexible system that can be adapted to any classroom environment.</p>

		<h2>Self-Determination and Secondary Transition Planning</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 3, 2017</h3>
		<p>"Enhanced self-determination improves the educational outcomes of youth with disabilities." - Wehmeyer &amp; Field, Self-Determination: Instructional and Assessment Strategies, 2007</p>
		<p>To address Connecticut’s current needs in secondary transition, the CT State Transition Task Force has identified 16 key areas that were determined to be critical to the post-school success of any student with a disability. These key areas are referred to as the CT CORE Transition Skills. In January 2016, the following skill was added: To the maximum extent possible, Each Student with a disability will be able to utilize effective self-determination skills including areas such as: choice-making, problem solving, goal-setting, communication, and self-advocacy. </p>
		<p>In addition, the passage of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) has led to Connecticut’s development of a new transition program for students enrolled in high school ages 16-21. This Level Up program has incorporated the instruction of self-advocacy as part of its pre-employment transition services.</p>
		<p>During this professional learning opportunity, participants will be introduced to a number of instructional and assessment strategies that will enable teachers and BRS/DORS counselors from Connecticut’s Bureau of Rehabilitation Services/Department of Rehabilitation Services (BRS/DORS) to promote student self-determination.</p>

		<h2>What Is Assistive Technology (AT) and How Can It Help My Child? - Elementary - Session B (In Spanish)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 7, 2017</h3>
		<p>If you are a parent of a middle or high school student with special needs, you have likely heard the term "assistive technology" or "AT," but you might not be familiar with exactly what that means or how it can enhance your child's learning in school, at home, or in the community.  In this session, parents/guardians will learn about the scope and functions of AT, and actually handle many of the low-, mid-, and high-tech devices (from SERC's AT Corner in the SERC Library) that can enhance student learning.</p>
		<p>Participants will have the opportunity to share their questions and experiences with other families participating in the session. Parents will discover how they and the rest of the Planning and Placement Team can determine their child’s need for AT; how to choose AT devices and systems that would make a positive difference in their child’s learning; how to advocate for providing their child with an AT device or product he or she needs; the child’s legal right to AT equipment; and how AT can help a student achieve Secondary Transition goals and objectives.</p>
		<p>This session is a collaboration among SERC, the CT Parent Information and Resource Center (CT PIRC), and the Connecticut Parent Advocacy Center (CPAC).</p>

		<h2>Differentiating Speech-Language Impairment from Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 14, 2017</h3>
		<p>The appropriate identification of SLD/Dyslexia in the elementary grades requires the input of speech and language pathologists (SLPs) who can offer planning and placement teams (PPTs) essential information about a student’s phonological processing and support differentiating a reading disability from a generalized speech-language impairment (SLI).</p>
		<p>On Day 1 of this professional learning opportunity, participants will review foundational information about SLD/Dyslexia, including its neurobiological basis, and will compare student data profiles consistent with this disability category in contrast to SLI. On Day 2, participants will bring their own student data (with confidential information redacted) and engage in facilitated group discussions about evaluation results and eligibility determination. On both days, participants will also have opportunities to interact with the extensive collection of special education assessments in SERC’s library.</p>
		<p>Speech and language pathologists completing this professional learning opportunity will illustrate the interactive processing systems underlying reading comprehension; explain the profiles of students with reading and oral language difficulties; map comprehensive assessment results to profiles of reading and oral language difficulties; and differentiate SLI from SLD/Dyslexia.</p>

		<h2>Special Education Professional Learning Modules: The Educational Benefit Review Process</h2>

Rowley, 1982) The Educational Benefit Review Process has been developed by the California Department of Education to examine how districts provide special education supports and services that result in educational benefit (Drouin, 2004). School teams will analyze their own IEP’s and consider the extent to which their students are afforded access, meaningful participation, and progress in general education over time. </p>

		<h2>Designing General Education Behavior Support Plans: A Practitioners Guide</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 29, 2017</h3>
		<p>In this session, school administration and staff will learn about systems and structures that aid in supporting students’ behavioral, social-emotional, and mental health needs. Participants will learn best practices for designing general education behavior support plans using their framework of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS).</p>
		<p>As participants learn more about the function-based behavior process for students, they will better understand the motivation, pay-off, or function of a student’s problem behavior. They will then use that information to identify and implement effective interventions to include in behavior intervention plans (BIPs), as part of their tiered supports.</p>

		<p>The Planning and Placement Team (PPT) chairperson works as part of the team to develop IEPs for students with disabilities that provide access and opportunities for meaningful participation and progress in the general education curriculum. Within schools, the PPT chairperson should ensure that the compliance requirements of the PPT process are met, that assessment data and goals and objectives are directly linked to the general education curriculum, and that placement decision-making occurs after the goals and objectives are developed.</p>
		<p>Participants in this professional learning activity will receive an overview of the rationale for the legal requirements of an individualized education program (IEP); develop in-depth knowledge about the PPT process and how it is to be properly documented; examine quality and compliance indicators of the components of the PPT process; learn how to foster culturally relevant family engagement; and examine/practice strategies for facilitating effective PPT meetings.</p>

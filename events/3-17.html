		<h2>CT Secondary Transition Community of Practice</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 9, 2017</h3>
		<p>Connecticut has created the CT Transition Community of Practice (CoP) to centralize all activities, resources, and initiatives related to secondary transition and to provide information and support to students, families, employers and professionals. The CoP is comprised of multiple stakeholder groups that have come together with a single focus: enhancing the transition of youth with disabilities to adult life. Come learn what we are all about, including the statewide Transition website and the wide range of Practice Groups that are working on innovative transition products, projects, and activities. See how your ideas fit into Connecticut’s overall plans and help us plot our course for the coming year!</p>

		<h2>Differentiating Speech-Language Impairment from Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 14, 2017</h3>
		<p>The appropriate identification of SLD/Dyslexia in the elementary grades requires the input of speech and language pathologists (SLPs) who can offer planning and placement teams (PPTs) essential information about a student’s phonological processing and support differentiating a reading disability from a generalized speech-language impairment (SLI).</p>
		<p>On Day 1 of this professional learning opportunity, participants will review foundational information about SLD/Dyslexia, including its neurobiological basis, and will compare student data profiles consistent with this disability category in contrast to SLI. On Day 2, participants will bring their own student data (with confidential information redacted) and engage in facilitated group discussions about evaluation results and eligibility determination. On both days, participants will also have opportunities to interact with the extensive collection of special education assessments in SERC’s library.</p>
		<p>Speech and language pathologists completing this professional learning opportunity will illustrate the interactive processing systems underlying reading comprehension; explain the profiles of students with reading and oral language difficulties; map comprehensive assessment results to profiles of reading and oral language difficulties; and differentiate SLI from SLD/Dyslexia.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

		<h2>Understanding the Transition from School to Adulthood for Students with Behavior/Mental Health Issues</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 17, 2017</h3>
		<p>During this professional learning session, participants will utilize case studies involving students with behavior and mental health needs and learn how these students can manage the various aspects of the secondary transition planning process. Through this review, participants will build their capacity to support students’ self-determination, time management/organization, choice making, problem solving, self-advocacy, and goal-setting skills.</p>

		<h2>Proud to Be Me, &amp; other Social Studies Themes in Early Childhood to Promote Positive Self Image</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 23, 2017</h3>
		<p>Positive self-image fosters achievement in all learners, especially students of color.  Families often socialize their children in ways that promote racial and ethnic pride, high expectations for learning, and positive behavior.  As educators serve the increasingly diverse needs of children and families, they must be prepared to support children’s growing curiosity about themselves, other people, and the communities in which they live and learn.</p>
		<p>Even in early childhood settings, learning about social studies can build on the family’s contribution to their child’s development of self-image. This two-day professional learning opportunity provides support and time for early childhood professionals developing social studies units for preschool and kindergarten children.</p>
		<p>Participants will learn about understanding and supporting positive self-image and identity and the role of family for all children; how to implement equitable learning and anti-bias education; and opportunities to develop a social studies curriculum and units of study using the CT Early Learning and Development Standards.</p>
		<p>Each participant is asked to bring lesson plan templates and/or a non-fiction or fiction picture book they wish to incorporate into the social studies unit they seek to create.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

		<h2>Designing General Education Behavior Support Plans: A Practitioners Guide</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 29, 2017</h3>
		<p>In this session, school administration and staff will learn about systems and structures that aid in supporting students’ behavioral, social-emotional, and mental health needs. Participants will learn best practices for designing general education behavior support plans using their framework of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS).</p>
		<p>As participants learn more about the function-based behavior process for students, they will better understand the motivation, pay-off, or function of a student’s problem behavior. They will then use that information to identify and implement effective interventions to include in behavior intervention plans (BIPs), as part of their tiered supports.</p>

		<h2>PPT Chairperson Training (Spring Session)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 30, 2017</h3>
		<p>The Planning and Placement Team (PPT) chairperson works as part of the team to develop IEPs for students with disabilities that provide access and opportunities for meaningful participation and progress in the general education curriculum. Within schools, the PPT chairperson should ensure that the compliance requirements of the PPT process are met, that assessment data and goals and objectives are directly linked to the general education curriculum, and that placement decision-making occurs after the goals and objectives are developed.</p>
		<p>Participants in this professional learning activity will receive an overview of the rationale for the legal requirements of an individualized education program (IEP); develop in-depth knowledge about the PPT process and how it is to be properly documented; examine quality and compliance indicators of the components of the PPT process; learn how to foster culturally relevant family engagement; and examine/practice strategies for facilitating effective PPT meetings.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

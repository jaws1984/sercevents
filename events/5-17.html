		<h2>Person-Centered Planning: Maps Train the Trainer Professional Learning Experience</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">May 4, 2017</h3>
		<p>Person-Centered Planning (PCP) is a set of approaches to life planning based on what a person considers most important. It is traditionally associated with individuals with disabilities. In an education setting, PCP involves specifying the opportunities, accommodations, and assistance that will give a student with disabilities the best chance of experiencing what is most important. </p>
		<p>This two-day train-the-trainer session for school teams will introduce them to the various person-centered planning programs, including the new Life Course Framework adopted by the Connecticut Department of Developmental Services. In addition, the teams will receive the materials and skills needed to facilitate a Making Action Plans (MAPS) session for students within their districts. Providing this PCP experience will help students, families, and educators identify a studentâ€™s post-school goals and determine the services needed to achieve those goals.</p>
		<p>This session requires registration by teams of 2 to 4. It is recommended the team include a parent of a student with disabilities.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>
		<p><strong>Multi-day Event: </strong>5/4/2017, 5/5/2017</p>

		<h2>Integrating your SRBI and PBIS Processes</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">May 17, 2017</h3>
		<p>Scientific Research-Based Interventions (SRBI )and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) are prevention-oriented systems of school functioning and resource allocation. Both PBIS and SRBI share defining characteristics that include: implementation with fidelity; a continuum of evidence-based practices; student performance as a measurement of success; continuous progress monitoring; data-based decision making and problem solving; and universal screening. PBIS and SRBI frameworks provide guidance for implementation of evidence-based practices along a continuum of Interventions and Supports for behavioral and social development.  In this session participants will learn ways to integrate their systems of academic intervention and behavior supports to maximize resources, efficiency, and outcomes for students.</p>

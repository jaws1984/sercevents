		<h2>Person-Centered Planning: Maps Train the Trainer Professional Learning Experience</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">May 4, 2017</h3>
		<p>Person-Centered Planning (PCP) is a set of approaches to life planning based on what a person considers most important. It is traditionally associated with individuals with disabilities. In an education setting, PCP involves specifying the opportunities, accommodations, and assistance that will give a student with disabilities the best chance of experiencing what is most important. </p>
		<p>This two-day train-the-trainer session for school teams will introduce them to the various person-centered planning programs, including the new Life Course Framework adopted by the Connecticut Department of Developmental Services. In addition, the teams will receive the materials and skills needed to facilitate a Making Action Plans (MAPS) session for students within their districts. Providing this PCP experience will help students, families, and educators identify a student’s post-school goals and determine the services needed to achieve those goals.</p>
		<p>This session requires registration by teams of 2 to 4. It is recommended the team include a parent of a student with disabilities.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>
		<p><strong>Multi-day Event: </strong>5/4/2017, 5/5/2017</p>

		<h2>Integrating your SRBI and PBIS Processes</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">May 17, 2017</h3>
		<p>Scientific Research-Based Interventions (SRBI )and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) are prevention-oriented systems of school functioning and resource allocation. Both PBIS and SRBI share defining characteristics that include: implementation with fidelity; a continuum of evidence-based practices; student performance as a measurement of success; continuous progress monitoring; data-based decision making and problem solving; and universal screening. PBIS and SRBI frameworks provide guidance for implementation of evidence-based practices along a continuum of Interventions and Supports for behavioral and social development.  In this session participants will learn ways to integrate their systems of academic intervention and behavior supports to maximize resources, efficiency, and outcomes for students.</p>

		<h2>Exploring Collaborative Roles for Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) in Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">May 19, 2017</h3>
		<p>A student’s planning and placement team (PPT) needs the expertise of many school professionals, including speech-language pathologists (SLPs), to appropriately identify a Specific Learning Disability (SLD)/Dyslexia and to implement specially designed structured literacy interventions.</p>
		<p>In this roundtable colloquium, SLPs will review the components of structured literacy and then access the resources of SERC’s Library to examine speech and language assessment tools that inform the SLD/Dyslexia comprehensive evaluation process. Subsequently, they will investigate research-based practices that support collaborative and consultative language-literacy interventions.</p>
		<p>SLPs participating in this professional learning opportunity will self-assess their collaborative PPT role in the identification of SLD/Dyslexia; expand their repertoire of assessment tools; and support language-literacy instruction for students with SLD/Dyslexia via collaboration and consultation.</p>

		<h2>An Alternative to Restraint/Seclusion: Nonviolent Crisis Intervention</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">May 24, 2017</h3>
		<p>A new Connecticut law (P.A. 15-141) has significantly changed how or whether schools use restraint and seclusion. School staff need to know how to defuse escalating situations and address disruptive behaviors before they lead to a crisis.</p>
		<p>This two-day session covers Nonviolent Crisis Intervention, which emphasizes early intervention and nonphysical methods for managing disruptive behavior. Participants will also have the opportunity to learn and practice prevention and deceleration strategies, assessing level of risk and making appropriate decisions, managing behavioral risk using disengagement, debriefing after a crisis, and coping with their own fear and anxiety.</p>

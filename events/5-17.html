		<h2>Integrating your SRBI and PBIS Processes</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">May 17, 2017</h3>
		<p>Scientific Research-Based Interventions (SRBI )and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) are prevention-oriented systems of school functioning and resource allocation. Both PBIS and SRBI share defining characteristics that include: implementation with fidelity; a continuum of evidence-based practices; student performance as a measurement of success; continuous progress monitoring; data-based decision making and problem solving; and universal screening. PBIS and SRBI frameworks provide guidance for implementation of evidence-based practices along a continuum of Interventions and Supports for behavioral and social development.  In this session participants will learn ways to integrate their systems of academic intervention and behavior supports to maximize resources, efficiency, and outcomes for students.</p>

		<h2>Making a Difference Through Co-Teaching (Session B)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">January 12, 2017</h3>
		<p>Co-teaching holds great promise within the framework of Scientific Research-Based Interventions (SRBI) as a universal practice for supporting students with diverse needs in general education settings. The talents, experiences, and expertise of the co-teaching team, both shared and varied, make for powerful and dynamic approaches to instruction.</p>
		<p>Co-teaching partnerships consist of a general educator and one other certified education professional, such as a special educator.  These partners collaborate to provide rich and differentiated learning opportunities and a sense of belonging for every student.</p>
		<p>This two-day session covers how co-teaching can effectively meet the needs of students, with and without disabilities, in the general education classroom and explores the advantages and disadvantages of each of the six co-teaching approaches.  Participants will apply their learning between the two days by planning and teaching a co-taught lesson, and then share their experiences with other participants on the second day.  In addition, a panel of local co-teachers will join us to share their experiences and answer questions from the audience.</p>
		<p>As a result of this professional learning activity, participants will be able to enhance the quality of their co-teaching partnerships; make decisions about which co-teaching approach will best help to improve student access and outcomes; and collaboratively plan co-taught lessons that maximize instructional intensity.  Optional follow-up technical assistance will be offered for those co-teaching teams that would like additional feedback through an on-site observation and/or coaching.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>
		<p><strong>Multi-day Event: </strong>1/12/2017, 2/28/2017</p>

		<h2>Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain: Promoting Authentic Engagement and Rigor Among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students’</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">January 23, 2016</h3>
		<p>What is culturally responsive teaching, and how can it make a difference in the classroom? This book study on Zaretta Hammond’s Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain will explore innovative approaches to designing and implementing brain-compatible culturally responsive instruction that creates inclusive learning for students of all colors, genders, ethnicity, and abilities. We will begin and end the study group with a face-to-face meeting, with an online discussion forum in between for a flexible and engaging way to explore cutting-edge neuroscience research. Participants will have the opportunity to apply principles and techniques in their classrooms and share results with this community of fellow practitioners over the course of 12 weeks.  At the conclusion of the course, participants will have the option to publish a blog post on the SERC website reviewing the book and sharing the part of the learning experience they valued most.</p>

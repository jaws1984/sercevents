		<h2>Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain: Promoting Authentic Engagement and Rigor Among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students’</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">January 23, 2016</h3>
		<p>What is culturally responsive teaching, and how can it make a difference in the classroom? This book study on Zaretta Hammond’s Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain will explore innovative approaches to designing and implementing brain-compatible culturally responsive instruction that creates inclusive learning for students of all colors, genders, ethnicity, and abilities. We will begin and end the study group with a face-to-face meeting, with an online discussion forum in between for a flexible and engaging way to explore cutting-edge neuroscience research. Participants will have the opportunity to apply principles and techniques in their classrooms and share results with this community of fellow practitioners over the course of 12 weeks.  At the conclusion of the course, participants will have the option to publish a blog post on the SERC website reviewing the book and sharing the part of the learning experience they valued most.</p>

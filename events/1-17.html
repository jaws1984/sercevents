		<h2>Webinar: Using Literacy Screening Data to Support Students with Reading Difficulties</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">January 10, 2017</h3>
		<p>The Connecticut Department of Education has approved universal screening reading assessments to be used by schools to identify students in kindergarten to grade three, who are below proficiency in reading. The results can provide school teams with valuable information about students’ phonological processing abilities, useful for creating instructional approaches that address students’ unique learning needs.</p>
		<p>This live webinar, featuring Dr. Margie Gillis, explores different patterns of reading difficulty based on screening data derived from the curriculum-based assessments in Connecticut’s Approved Menu of Research-based Grades K-3 Universal Screening Reading Assessments. Dr. Gillis will also provide guidance regarding informal diagnostic assessments that could be used to examine component reading skills in more depth, including an assessment decision tree. She will present an overview of structured literacy instruction methods that can be used in Tier 2 to support reading success for children in the early grades and tools for progress monitoring.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

		<h2>Making a Difference Through Co-Teaching (Session B)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">January 12, 2017</h3>
		<p>Co-teaching holds great promise within the framework of Scientific Research-Based Interventions (SRBI) as a universal practice for supporting students with diverse needs in general education settings. The talents, experiences, and expertise of the co-teaching team, both shared and varied, make for powerful and dynamic approaches to instruction.</p>
		<p>Co-teaching partnerships consist of a general educator and one other certified education professional, such as a special educator.  These partners collaborate to provide rich and differentiated learning opportunities and a sense of belonging for every student.</p>
		<p>This two-day session covers how co-teaching can effectively meet the needs of students, with and without disabilities, in the general education classroom and explores the advantages and disadvantages of each of the six co-teaching approaches.  Participants will apply their learning between the two days by planning and teaching a co-taught lesson, and then share their experiences with other participants on the second day.  In addition, a panel of local co-teachers will join us to share their experiences and answer questions from the audience.</p>
		<p>As a result of this professional learning activity, participants will be able to enhance the quality of their co-teaching partnerships; make decisions about which co-teaching approach will best help to improve student access and outcomes; and collaboratively plan co-taught lessons that maximize instructional intensity.  Optional follow-up technical assistance will be offered for those co-teaching teams that would like additional feedback through an on-site observation and/or coaching.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>
		<p><strong>Multi-day Event: </strong>1/12/2017, 2/28/2017</p>

		<h2>Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain: Promoting Authentic Engagement and Rigor Among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students’</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">January 23, 2016</h3>
		<p>What is culturally responsive teaching, and how can it make a difference in the classroom? This book study on Zaretta Hammond’s Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain will explore innovative approaches to designing and implementing brain-compatible culturally responsive instruction that creates inclusive learning for students of all colors, genders, ethnicity, and abilities. We will begin and end the study group with a face-to-face meeting, with an online discussion forum in between for a flexible and engaging way to explore cutting-edge neuroscience research. Participants will have the opportunity to apply principles and techniques in their classrooms and share results with this community of fellow practitioners over the course of 12 weeks.  At the conclusion of the course, participants will have the option to publish a blog post on the SERC website reviewing the book and sharing the part of the learning experience they valued most.</p>

		<h2>Developing Functional Behavior Assessments (FBAs) and Behavior Intervention Plans (BIPs)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">January 24, 2017</h3>
		<p>In this two-part session, school administration and staff will learn about systems and structures that aid in supporting students’ behavioral, social-emotional, and mental health needs. Participants will learn best practices for conducting functional behavior assessments (FBAs) and developing and writing effective behavior intervention plans (BIPs) for students who need behavioral supports.</p>
		<p>As participants learn more about the FBA process for these students, they will better understand the motivation, pay-off, or function of a student’s problem behavior. They will then use that information to identify and implement effective interventions to include in BIPs.</p>

		<h2>Middle School Math: Making Meaning with Manipulatives</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">January 24, 2017</h3>
		<p>Elementary math classes often incorporate manipulatives to help students extend their math reasoning from concrete to abstract.  Too often, this practice is abandoned in the higher grades.  Yet the use of manipulatives by learners of all ages is an effective way to increase conceptual understanding of math concepts, as called for by the Connecticut Core Standards (CCS) for Math.  Manipulatives can be especially useful for English learners, struggling math learners, and any student who may be disengaged.</p>
		<p>In the four sessions of this series, middle school educators will be introduced to fraction bars and algebra tiles.  Participants will practice using these manipulatives and incorporate them into lessons aligned with the CCS. Throughout the school year, between sessions, the participants will post ideas through a web-based platform. At the final session, participants will share their classroom experiences and lessons with one another.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>3:30 p.m.</p>
		<p><strong>Multi-day Event: </strong>1/24/2017, 2/28/2017, 3/8/2017, 5/2/2017</p>

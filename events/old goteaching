<p><img src="/assets/images/initiatives/co-teaching/coteaching-logo.gif" style="float:right; margin:15px;" />Initially part of SIP, SERC’s Co-Teaching Program has grown tremendously since 1997. Co-teaching is a practical model for effectively addressing the complex challenge of meeting the diverse learning needs of all students in general classrooms, including students with disabilities. Co-teaching can also provide a lower student-teacher ratio that optimizes student learning. Training is centered on <span style="color: #000000;">six different co-teaching approaches</span> with discussion on the principles, practices, and pragmatics of each approach. Technical assistance is available to teams as they implement and practice co-teaching strategies.</p>

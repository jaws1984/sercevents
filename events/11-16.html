		<h2>Transition Planning: Connecting the Pieces of the Secondary Transition Process</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 1, 2016</h3>
		<p>The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA 2004) mandates that secondary transition services be designed to encompass both academic achievement and functional performance that facilitates movement from school to post-school activities for EACH student with a disability. The State Performance Plan (SPP) Indicator 13 specifies that these requirements be addressed in a student’s individualized education program (IEP).</p>
		<p>During this professional learning activity, participants will utilize various transition tools to review their current practices regarding secondary transition planning and the requirements to meet the needs of all students. They will focus on the alignment of the various pieces of the IEP and reflect on how they have gone "Above and Beyond Compliance." This will allow participants to "piece the puzzle together" to ensure quality Secondary Transition supports and services.</p>
		<p>SERC will provide each district participating in these sessions with yearlong support through online training modules of instruction and the development of a Professional Learning Network over Schoology. Districts will also receive a transition resource book to support secondary transition programming.</p> 
		<p>Participating districts interested in on-site technical assistance may contract with SERC for additional services during the 2016-2017 school year.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

		<h2>Building District Capacity to Conduct Comprehensive Evaluations for Students Suspected of Having Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 2, 2016</h3>
		<p>Special education directors and supervisors of special education are invited to self-examine their district capacity to evaluate the phonological processing skills and language-literacy needs of students suspected of having specific learning disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia. In this job-embedded professional learning opportunity, they will apply the content of Connecticut’s Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia Assessment Guide (CSDE/SERC, 2016) within the framework of comprehensive evaluations detailed in Connecticut’s Guidelines for Identifying Children with Learning Disabilities (2010). Participants will review the components of reading, spelling, and oral language essential to the identification of SLD/Dyslexia and engage in a structured facilitated process, examining their district’s capacity to support the comprehensive evaluation process.</p>
		<p>Administrators and supervisors completing this professional learning opportunity will summarize the component reading, spelling, and oral language skills essential to reading, spelling, and written language; self-examine the collective expertise of their educators to conduct comprehensive evaluations to identify SLD/Dyslexia; and create a focused action plan that addresses systemic gaps.</p>

		<h2>Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain: Promoting Authentic Engagement and Rigor Among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students’</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 7, 2016</h3>
		<p>What is culturally responsive teaching, and how can it make a difference in the classroom? This book study on Zaretta Hammond’s Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain will explore innovative approaches to designing and implementing brain-compatible culturally responsive instruction that creates inclusive learning for students of all colors, genders, ethnicity, and abilities. We will begin and end the study group with a face-to-face meeting, with an online discussion forum in between for a flexible and engaging way to explore cutting-edge neuroscience research. Participants will have the opportunity to apply principles and techniques in their classrooms and share results with this community of fellow practitioners over the course of 12 weeks.  At the conclusion of the course, participants will have the option to publish a blog post on the SERC website reviewing the book and sharing the part of the learning experience they valued most.</p>

		<h2>Using Technology and Interactive Tools to Enhance Literacy Learning in the Preschool and Kindergarten Classroom</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 16, 2016</h3>
		<p>Early childhood educators may look to technology as a tool to enhance development of children from diverse learning backgrounds.

		<h2>Introduction to Orton - Gillingham Training Approach</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 30, 2016</h3>
		<p>Students who struggle learning to read, write, or spell, particularly students with specific learning disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia, require structured literacy instruction to close their achievement gaps. This 30-hour introduction to the Orton-Gillingham (O-G) Approach, presented by a certified fellow of the Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators (AOGPE) from the Learning House in Guilford, CT, will introduce the underpinnings of structured literacy and the instructional practices of the O-G approach. Educators will receive training in the components of language that support reading acquisition and a scope and sequence of instructional approaches appropriate for struggling learners.</p>
		<p>Participants completing this course of study will be able to explain the principles of O-G instruction; summarize the components of language related to reading acquisition; develop O-G lesson plans; and implement O-G instruction with students struggling to learn to read, write, or spell, including students with SLD/Dyslexia. The registration fee includes the O-G Manual.</p>
		<p>Please Note: Independent implementation of O-G instruction requires additional training and supervision.</p>

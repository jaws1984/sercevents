		<h2>Building District Capacity to Conduct Comprehensive Evaluations for Students Suspected of Having Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 2, 2016</h3>
		<p>Special education directors and supervisors of special education are invited to self-examine their district capacity to evaluate the phonological processing skills and language-literacy needs of students suspected of having specific learning disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia. In this job-embedded professional learning opportunity, they will apply the content of Connecticut’s Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia Assessment Guide (CSDE/SERC, 2016) within the framework of comprehensive evaluations detailed in Connecticut’s Guidelines for Identifying Children with Learning Disabilities (2010). Participants will review the components of reading, spelling, and oral language essential to the identification of SLD/Dyslexia and engage in a structured facilitated process, examining their district’s capacity to support the comprehensive evaluation process.</p>
		<p>Administrators and supervisors completing this professional learning opportunity will summarize the component reading, spelling, and oral language skills essential to reading, spelling, and written language; self-examine the collective expertise of their educators to conduct comprehensive evaluations to identify SLD/Dyslexia; and create a focused action plan that addresses systemic gaps.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

		<h2>Introduction to Restorative Practices</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 17, 2016</h3>
		<p>Restorative Practices, inspired by the philosophy of restorative justice, are used to build community and respond to challenging behavior through authentic dialogue, coming to understanding, and making things right [International Institute for Restorative Practices website, 2013]. Schools that use Restorative Practices have a flexible approach to school policies and practices when managing challenging behavior.</p>
		<p>This training will offer participants the opportunity to understand Restorative Practices as a more flexible school-wide approach to discipline. It will cover the core values, principles, and goals of Restorative Practices; provide an overview of various models and components; and identify stakeholders in the Restorative Practices process. As a result of this training, participants will better understand the necessary resources for implementing Restorative Practices in schools, including implementation within a multi-tiered system of support.</p>

		<h2>Introduction to Orton - Gillingham Training Approach</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">November 30, 2016</h3>
		<p>Students who struggle learning to read, write, or spell, particularly students with specific learning disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia, require structured literacy instruction to close their achievement gaps. This 30-hour introduction to the Orton-Gillingham (O-G) Approach, presented by a certified fellow of the Academy of Orton-Gillingham Practitioners and Educators (AOGPE) from the Learning House in Guilford, CT, will introduce the underpinnings of structured literacy and the instructional practices of the O-G approach. Educators will receive training in the components of language that support reading acquisition and a scope and sequence of instructional approaches appropriate for struggling learners.</p>
		<p>Participants completing this course of study will be able to explain the principles of O-G instruction; summarize the components of language related to reading acquisition; develop O-G lesson plans; and implement O-G instruction with students struggling to learn to read, write, or spell, including students with SLD/Dyslexia. The registration fee includes the O-G Manual.</p>
		<p>Please Note: Independent implementation of O-G instruction requires additional training and supervision.</p>

		<h2>Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain: Promoting Authentic Engagement and Rigor Among Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">October 20, 2016</h3>
		<p>We know that students learning English face two sets of demands: to learn the content and to learn English at the same time. This requires strategies that will allow them to access the skills and concepts needed to comprehend academic content as their proficiency in English grows.</p>
		<p>This session examines teaching and learning activities that can support students learning English in acquiring academic language while increasing comprehension of subject-area content. The strategies in this session will also be beneficial for students with language-based learning disabilities.</p>
		<p>Participants will draft teaching and learning activities that will support students learning English in their content area, identifying skills and strategies that can translate into their classroom practice.</p>

		<h2>PPT Chairperson Training (Fall Session)</h2>

		<h2>Building Relationships with Families for Student Success: Full-Day Training for School and District Staff</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">October 25, 2016</h3>
		<p><strong>Participants choose from one of two sessions:</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Session A: Home Visits that Bridge, Bond and Build Connections between Families and Schools</strong><br/>
		The Parent/Teacher Home Visit Project is nationally known for a proven model of home visits that end the cycle of blame between families and school staff by building trust and respect, instilling cultural competency, and increasing personal and professional capacity for all involved.  This session is designed for PK-12 schools and districts new to strategic and organized home visit efforts. This interactive session -- led by a team of parents and teachers who are directly involved in the work -- introduces the research, logistics, step-by-step guide, practice and skills of building effective relationships between families and teachers as co-educators of a child. It also addresses the barriers to communication and visits including language and cultural barriers, assumptions and fears about personal safety, mandated reporting concerns, etc.  At the end of the session, participants will be prepared to conduct home visits with families in their school. </p>

		<p><strong>Session B: Real Dads Forever: Fatherhood Strategies</strong><br/>
		This workshop will focus on a partnering approach for engaging fathers and family men in the lives of their children and families. Building on fathers’ unique strengths and perspectives, this session will take a deep look at the processes that are most successful. The goal is to create age-appropriate, gender-specific and culturally responsive fatherhood development strategies that enhance the emotional, physical, social and spiritual relationship between fathers and family men and their children. Participants will explore the barriers to partnering, unconscious biases, the skills and assets of dads, and their untapped potential -- ultimately discovering ways to build more connections with dads.</p>

		<h2>Making a Difference Through Co-Teaching</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">October 26, 2016</h3>
		<p>Co-teaching holds great promise within the framework of Scientific Research-Based Interventions (SRBI) as a universal practice for supporting students with diverse needs in general education settings. The talents, experiences, and expertise of the co-teaching team, both shared and varied, make for powerful and dynamic approaches to instruction.
		Co-teaching partnerships consist of a general educator and one other certified education professional, such as a special educator.  These partners collaborate to provide rich and differentiated learning opportunities and a sense of belonging for every student.</p>
		<p>This two-day session covers how co-teaching can effectively meet the needs of students, with and without disabilities, in the general education classroom and explores the advantages and disadvantages of each of the six co-teaching approaches.  Participants will apply their learning between the two days by planning and teaching a co-taught lesson, and then share their experiences with other participants on the second day.  In addition, a panel of local co-teachers will join us to share their experiences and answer questions from the audience.</p>
		<p>As a result of this professional learning activity, participants will be able to enhance the quality of their co-teaching partnerships; make decisions about which co-teaching approach will best help to improve student access and outcomes; and collaboratively plan co-taught lessons that maximize instructional intensity.  Optional follow-up technical assistance will be offered for those co-teaching teams that would like additional feedback through an on-site observation and/or coaching.</p>

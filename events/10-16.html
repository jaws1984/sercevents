		<h2>PPT Chairperson Training (Fall Session)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">October 25, 2016</h3>
		<p>The Planning and Placement Team (PPT) chairperson works as part of the team to develop IEPs for students with disabilities that provide access and opportunities for meaningful participation and progress in the general education curriculum. Within schools, the PPT chairperson should ensure that the compliance requirements of the PPT process are met, that assessment data and goals and objectives are directly linked to the general education curriculum, and that placement decision-making occurs after the goals and objectives are developed.</p>
		<p>Participants in this professional learning activity will receive an overview of the rationale for the legal requirements of an individualized education program (IEP); develop in-depth knowledge about the PPT process and how it is to be properly documented; examine quality and compliance indicators of the components of the PPT process; learn how to foster culturally relevant family engagement; and examine/practice strategies for facilitating effective PPT meetings.</p>

		<h2>Making a Difference Through Co-Teaching</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">October 26, 2016</h3>
		<p>Co-teaching holds great promise within the framework of Scientific Research-Based Interventions (SRBI) as a universal practice for supporting students with diverse needs in general education settings. The talents, experiences, and expertise of the co-teaching team, both shared and varied, make for powerful and dynamic approaches to instruction.
		Co-teaching partnerships consist of a general educator and one other certified education professional, such as a special educator.  These partners collaborate to provide rich and differentiated learning opportunities and a sense of belonging for every student.</p>
		<p>This two-day session covers how co-teaching can effectively meet the needs of students, with and without disabilities, in the general education classroom and explores the advantages and disadvantages of each of the six co-teaching approaches.  Participants will apply their learning between the two days by planning and teaching a co-taught lesson, and then share their experiences with other participants on the second day.  In addition, a panel of local co-teachers will join us to share their experiences and answer questions from the audience.</p>
		<p>As a result of this professional learning activity, participants will be able to enhance the quality of their co-teaching partnerships; make decisions about which co-teaching approach will best help to improve student access and outcomes; and collaboratively plan co-taught lessons that maximize instructional intensity.  Optional follow-up technical assistance will be offered for those co-teaching teams that would like additional feedback through an on-site observation and/or coaching.</p>

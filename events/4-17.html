		<h2>What Is Assistive Technology (AT) and How Can It Help My Child? - Secondary - Session B (In Spanish)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 4, 2017</h3>
		<p>If you are a parent of a middle or high school student with special needs, you have likely heard the term "assistive technology" or "AT," but you might not be familiar with exactly what that means or how it can enhance your child's learning in school, at home, or in the community.  In this session, parents/guardians will learn about the scope and functions of AT, and actually handle many of the low-, mid-, and high-tech devices (from SERC's AT Corner in the SERC Library) that can enhance student learning.</p>
		<p>Participants will have the opportunity to share their questions and experiences with other families participating in the session. Parents will discover how they and the rest of the Planning and Placement Team can determine their child’s need for AT; how to choose AT devices and systems that would make a positive difference in their child’s learning; how to advocate for providing their child with an AT device or product he or she needs; the child’s legal right to AT equipment; and how AT can help a student achieve Secondary Transition goals and objectives.</p>
		<p>This session is a collaboration among SERC, the CT Parent Information and Resource Center (CT PIRC), and the Connecticut Parent Advocacy Center (CPAC).</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>5:30 p.m.</p>

		<h2>Creating Measurable Behavioral/Social Emotional IEP Goals &amp; Objectives</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 4, 2017</h3>
		<p>This professional development opportunity covers how to write effective behavioral and social-emotional goals and objectives for individualized education programs (IEPs). The goals must be SMART -- Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely -- and meet the rigorous expectations set forth by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA 2004).</p>
		<p>Goals for behavior, however, are often vague and left up to interpretation. So this session will help participants write clearer, measurable, and attainable behavior goals to better track student progress; identify appropriate accommodations, modifications, and supports needed to attain those goals; and foster student success by helping them internalize the skills that are relevant in their everyday life.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>
		<p><strong>Multi-day Event: </strong>4/4/2017, 4/5/2017</p>

		<h2>Finding and Using Low-Cost/No-Cost Technologies for the Classroom - Session A</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 26, 2016</h3>
		<p>This learning opportunity will introduce educators and families of students with disabilities and learning differences to low-cost/no-cost technologies that support learning in school and at home.</p>
		<p>The Internet and app stores are full of resources, software, and apps that are of little cost or entirely free. Participants will learn how many of these valuable technologies support student learning by providing alternative means of accessing the curriculum. These technologies include open source software, free and low-cost apps for iPad and Chrome book, Google apps, and free literacy and teaching resources and websites.</p>
		<p>This training will provide context and examples for the use of these technologies. Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to explore SERC’s new Assistive Technology Corner that features displays and demonstrations of various assistive technologies.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

		<h2>Middle School Math: Making Meaning with Manipulatives</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 28, 2017</h3>
		<p>Elementary math classes often incorporate manipulatives to help students extend their math reasoning from concrete to abstract.  Too often, this practice is abandoned in the higher grades.  Yet the use of manipulatives by learners of all ages is an effective way to increase conceptual understanding of math concepts, as called for by the Connecticut Core Standards (CCS) for Math.  Manipulatives can be especially useful for English learners, struggling math learners, and any student who may be disengaged.</p>
	    <p>In this full-day session, middle school educators will be introduced to fraction bars and algebra tiles.  Participants will practice using these manipulatives and develop strategies to incorporate them into lessons aligned with the CCS.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

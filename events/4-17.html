		<h2>What Is Assistive Technology (AT) and How Can It Help My Child? - Secondary - Session B (In Spanish)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 4, 2017</h3>
		<p>If you are a parent of a middle or high school student with special needs, you have likely heard the term "assistive technology" or "AT," but you might not be familiar with exactly what that means or how it can enhance your child's learning in school, at home, or in the community.  In this session, parents/guardians will learn about the scope and functions of AT, and actually handle many of the low-, mid-, and high-tech devices (from SERC's AT Corner in the SERC Library) that can enhance student learning.</p>
		<p>Participants will have the opportunity to share their questions and experiences with other families participating in the session. Parents will discover how they and the rest of the Planning and Placement Team can determine their child’s need for AT; how to choose AT devices and systems that would make a positive difference in their child’s learning; how to advocate for providing their child with an AT device or product he or she needs; the child’s legal right to AT equipment; and how AT can help a student achieve Secondary Transition goals and objectives.</p>
		<p>This session is a collaboration among SERC, the CT Parent Information and Resource Center (CT PIRC), and the Connecticut Parent Advocacy Center (CPAC).</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>5:30 p.m.</p>

		<h2>Creating Measurable Behavioral/Social Emotional IEP Goals &amp; Objectives</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 4, 2017</h3>
		<p>This professional development opportunity covers how to write effective behavioral and social-emotional goals and objectives for individualized education programs (IEPs). The goals must be SMART -- Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely -- and meet the rigorous expectations set forth by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA 2004).</p>
		<p>Goals for behavior, however, are often vague and left up to interpretation. So this session will help participants write clearer, measurable, and attainable behavior goals to better track student progress; identify appropriate accommodations, modifications, and supports needed to attain those goals; and foster student success by helping them internalize the skills that are relevant in their everyday life.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

		<h2>Special Education Professional Learning Modules: Developing IEP Goals and Objectives Aligned with the CT Core Standards</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 6, 2017</h3>
		<p>According to the Federal Office of Special Education Programs, ensuring all children, including children with disabilities, are held to rigorous academic standards and high expectations is a shared responsibility for all of us. To help make certain that children with disabilities are held to high expectations and have meaningful access to Connecticut’s core state standards, an individualized education program (IEP) for an eligible child with a disability under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) must be aligned with the State’s academic content standards for the grade in which the child is enrolled. Participants will gain a deeper understanding of best practices in developing student IEP’s through the lens of the CT Core Standards.</p>

		<h2>PBIS Info Session</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 7, 2017</h3>
		<p>This session provides an overview of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and the district and school application process for PBIS implementation. </p>
		<p>PBIS is a systems-based approach to adopting and implementing evidence-based practices in order to improve academic and behavioral outcomes for all students. It emphasizes the use of data to determine effective behavioral practices and develop a school-wide system, using a continuum of supports ranging from universal to individualized.</p>
		<p>This session is intended for districts that would like to begin implementing PBIS at their schools and for individual schools that have not implemented PBIS yet, although other schools in their district may have. It is also open to schools or districts that have existing behavioral programs and are looking to incorporate them into PBIS.</p>
		<p>Participants will learn how PBIS works to improve overall school climate, maximize academic achievement for all students, and address both non-classroom and classroom management/disciplinary issues, as well as the specific needs of students with severe emotional and behavioral concerns.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>8:30 a.m.</p>

		<h2>Math for Everyone: Strengthening Tier I Instruction</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 26, 2017</h3>
		<p>Math classes are increasingly comprised of students with widely varying skill levels.  Teachers are challenged to effectively provide access to the math curriculum for every student.  This conference will help secondary math teachers meet this challenge.</p>
		<p>The keynote speaker, Max Ray-Riek from the Math Forum at NCTM, will address the importance of using rich tasks to move students toward mathematical goals.  A math team from a local school will present its math program challenges and successes.  The afternoon will include time for facilitated planning for math teachers/teams to begin planning how to embed some of these techniques into their own curricula and classrooms.</p>
		<p>Math educators will walk away from this conference with concrete research-based ideas that will help strengthen their Tier I math instruction.</p>

		<h2>Proud to Be Me, and Other Social Studies Themes in Early Childhood to Promote Positive Self Image</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 27, 2017</h3>
		<p>Positive self-image fosters achievement in all learners, especially students of color.  Families often socialize their children in ways that promote racial and ethnic pride, high expectations for learning, and positive behavior.  As educators serve the increasingly diverse needs of children and families, they must be prepared to support children’s growing curiosity about themselves, other people, and the communities in which they live and learn.</p>
		<p>Even in early childhood settings, learning about social studies can build on the family’s contribution to their child’s development of self-image. This two-day professional learning opportunity provides support and time for early childhood professionals developing social studies units for preschool and kindergarten children.</p>
		<p>Participants will learn about understanding and supporting positive self-image and identity and the role of family for all children; how to implement equitable learning and anti-bias education; and opportunities to develop a social studies curriculum and units of study using the CT Early Learning and Development Standards.</p>
		<p>Each participant is asked to bring lesson plan templates and/or a non-fiction or fiction picture book they wish to incorporate into the social studies unit they seek to create.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

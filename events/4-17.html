		<h2>What Is Assistive Technology (AT) and How Can It Help My Child? - Secondary - Session B (In Spanish)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 4, 2017</h3>
		<p>If you are a parent of a middle or high school student with special needs, you have likely heard the term "assistive technology" or "AT," but you might not be familiar with exactly what that means or how it can enhance your child's learning in school, at home, or in the community.  In this session, parents/guardians will learn about the scope and functions of AT, and actually handle many of the low-, mid-, and high-tech devices (from SERC's AT Corner in the SERC Library) that can enhance student learning.</p>
		<p>Participants will have the opportunity to share their questions and experiences with other families participating in the session. Parents will discover how they and the rest of the Planning and Placement Team can determine their child’s need for AT; how to choose AT devices and systems that would make a positive difference in their child’s learning; how to advocate for providing their child with an AT device or product he or she needs; the child’s legal right to AT equipment; and how AT can help a student achieve Secondary Transition goals and objectives.</p>
		<p>This session is a collaboration among SERC, the CT Parent Information and Resource Center (CT PIRC), and the Connecticut Parent Advocacy Center (CPAC).</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>5:30 p.m.</p>

		<h2>Creating Measurable Behavioral/Social Emotional IEP Goals &amp; Objectives</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 4, 2017</h3>
		<p>This professional development opportunity covers how to write effective behavioral and social-emotional goals and objectives for individualized education programs (IEPs). The goals must be SMART -- Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely -- and meet the rigorous expectations set forth by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA 2004).</p>
		<p>Goals for behavior, however, are often vague and left up to interpretation. So this session will help participants write clearer, measurable, and attainable behavior goals to better track student progress; identify appropriate accommodations, modifications, and supports needed to attain those goals; and foster student success by helping them internalize the skills that are relevant in their everyday life.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>
		<p><strong>Multi-day Event: </strong>4/4/2017, 4/5/2017</p>

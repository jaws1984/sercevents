		<h2>Making Early Literacy FUNTASTIC for Infants and Toddlers</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 1, 2017</h3>
		<p>Engaging infants and toddlers in early literacy activities will give them a great start to using new skills:  play, communication and socialization with others, language and vocabulary, and early reading.  We now know that enriched early experiences that include intentional positive interaction, meaningful talk, and opportunities to play and manipulate objects and toys are critical while young brains are developing.</p>
		<p>The primary outcome of this professional learning opportunity is building early literacy learning for infants and toddlers that is "Funtastic." For early childhood professionals, this includes developmentally appropriate practice in planning safe, engaging, creative environments and materials; creating learning activities to meet the needs of diverse learners of all abilities; learning how to embed Funtastic literacy activities in daily routines using an ecological inventory; and supporting families to use routines at home for early literacy learning.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

		<h2>What Is Assistive Technology (AT) and How Can It Help My Child? - Elementary - Session A - English Session</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 3, 2017</h3>
		<p>If you are a parent of a middle or high school student with special needs, you have likely heard the term "assistive technology" or "AT," but you might not be familiar with exactly what that means or how it can enhance your child's learning in school, at home, or in the community.  In this session, parents/guardians will learn about the scope and functions of AT, and actually handle many of the low-, mid-, and high-tech devices (from SERC's AT Corner in the SERC Library) that can enhance student learning.</p>
		<p>Participants will have the opportunity to share their questions and experiences with other families participating in the session. Parents will discover how they and the rest of the Planning and Placement Team can determine their child’s need for AT; how to choose AT devices and systems that would make a positive difference in their child’s learning; how to advocate for providing their child with an AT device or product he or she needs; the child’s legal right to AT equipment; and how AT can help a student achieve Secondary Transition goals and objectives.</p>
		<p>This session is a collaboration among SERC, the CT Parent Information and Resource Center (CT PIRC), and the Connecticut Parent Advocacy Center (CPAC).</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>5:30 p.m.</p>

		<h2>Content Literacy Strategies for Students Learning English</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 7, 2017</h3>
		<p>We know that students learning English face two sets of demands: to learn the content and to learn English at the same time. This requires strategies that will allow them to access the skills and concepts needed to comprehend academic content as their proficiency in English grows.</p>
		<p>This session examines teaching and learning activities that can support students learning English in acquiring academic language while increasing comprehension of subject-area content. The strategies in this session will also be beneficial for students with language-based learning disabilities.</p>
		<p>Participants will draft teaching and learning activities that will support students learning English in their content area, identifying skills and strategies that can translate into their classroom practice.</p>

		<h2>Introduction to Restorative Practices</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 9, 2016</h3>
		<p>Restorative Practices, inspired by the philosophy of restorative justice, are used to build community and respond to challenging behavior through authentic dialogue, coming to understanding, and making things right [International Institute for Restorative Practices website, 2013]. Schools that use Restorative Practices have a flexible approach to school policies and practices when managing challenging behavior.</p>
		<p>This training will offer participants the opportunity to understand Restorative Practices as a more flexible school-wide approach to discipline. It will cover the core values, principles, and goals of Restorative Practices; provide an overview of various models and components; and identify stakeholders in the Restorative Practices process. As a result of this training, participants will better understand the necessary resources for implementing Restorative Practices in schools, including implementation within a multi-tiered system of support.</p>

		<h2>Building a bridge between Tier 2 and Tier 3 Interventions</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 10, 2017</h3>
		<p>Within a system of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), schools create layers of instructional tiers to match levels of support to students’ needs. However, there are contradictory descriptions of Tier 2 and Tier 3, and often there is confusion that needs further clarification on how to intensify instruction within PBIS. To provide that clarity, the session will review the differences between Tier 2 and Tier 3. Participants should come to the session equipped with their tier 2 and tier 3 data, list of interventions, and questions!</p>

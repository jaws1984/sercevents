		<h2>Making Early Literacy FUNTASTIC for Infants and Toddlers</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 1, 2017</h3>
		<p>Engaging infants and toddlers in early literacy activities will give them a great start to using new skills:  play, communication and socialization with others, language and vocabulary, and early reading.  We now know that enriched early experiences that include intentional positive interaction, meaningful talk, and opportunities to play and manipulate objects and toys are critical while young brains are developing.</p>
		<p>The primary outcome of this professional learning opportunity is building early literacy learning for infants and toddlers that is "Funtastic." For early childhood professionals, this includes developmentally appropriate practice in planning safe, engaging, creative environments and materials; creating learning activities to meet the needs of diverse learners of all abilities; learning how to embed Funtastic literacy activities in daily routines using an ecological inventory; and supporting families to use routines at home for early literacy learning.</p>

		<h2>Content Literacy Strategies for Students Learning English</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 7, 2017</h3>
		<p>We know that students learning English face two sets of demands: to learn the content and to learn English at the same time. This requires strategies that will allow them to access the skills and concepts needed to comprehend academic content as their proficiency in English grows.</p>
		<p>This session examines teaching and learning activities that can support students learning English in acquiring academic language while increasing comprehension of subject-area content. The strategies in this session will also be beneficial for students with language-based learning disabilities.</p>
		<p>Participants will draft teaching and learning activities that will support students learning English in their content area, identifying skills and strategies that can translate into their classroom practice.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

		<h2>Building a bridge between Tier 2 and Tier 3 Interventions</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 10, 2017</h3>
		<p>Within a system of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), schools create layers of instructional tiers to match levels of support to students’ needs. However, there are contradictory descriptions of Tier 2 and Tier 3, and often there is confusion that needs further clarification on how to intensify instruction within PBIS. To provide that clarity, the session will review the differences between Tier 2 and Tier 3. Participants should come to the session equipped with their tier 2 and tier 3 data, list of interventions, and questions!</p>

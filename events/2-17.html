		<h2>Making Early Literacy FUNTASTIC for Infants and Toddlers</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 1, 2017</h3>
		<p>Engaging infants and toddlers in early literacy activities will give them a great start to using new skills:  play, communication and socialization with others, language and vocabulary, and early reading.  We now know that enriched early experiences that include intentional positive interaction, meaningful talk, and opportunities to play and manipulate objects and toys are critical while young brains are developing.</p>
		<p>The primary outcome of this professional learning opportunity is building early literacy learning for infants and toddlers that is "Funtastic." For early childhood professionals, this includes developmentally appropriate practice in planning safe, engaging, creative environments and materials; creating learning activities to meet the needs of diverse learners of all abilities; learning how to embed Funtastic literacy activities in daily routines using an ecological inventory; and supporting families to use routines at home for early literacy learning.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

		<h2>Mental Health First Aid</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 1, 2017</h3>
		<p>You are more likely to encounter someone -- friend, family member, student, neighbor, or member of the community -- in an emotional or mental health crisis than someone having a heart attack. Mental Health First Aid teaches a 5-step action plan to offer initial help to young people showing signs of a mental illness or in a crisis, and connect them with the appropriate professional, peer, social, or self-help care. </p>
		<p>This course is intended for teachers, support staff, paraeducators, coaches, and other school employees who have frequent contact with youth. Participants will have time to action plan to strategize a procedure for intervening with identified students.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>
		<p><strong>Multi-day Event: </strong>2/1/2017, 2/2/2017</p>

		<h2>Building a bridge between Tier 2 and Tier 3 Interventions</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">February 10, 2017</h3>
		<p>Within a system of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), schools create layers of instructional tiers to match levels of support to studentsâ€™ needs. However, there are contradictory descriptions of Tier 2 and Tier 3, and often there is confusion that needs further clarification on how to intensify instruction within PBIS. To provide that clarity, the session will review the differences between Tier 2 and Tier 3. Participants should come to the session equipped with their tier 2 and tier 3 data, list of interventions, and questions!</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>

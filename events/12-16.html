		<h2>What Is Assistive Technology (AT) and How Can It Help My Child? - Elementary - Session A - English Session</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">December 7, 2016</h3>
		<p>If you are a parent of a middle or high school student with special needs, you have likely heard the term "assistive technology" or "AT," but you might not be familiar with exactly what that means or how it can enhance your child's learning in school, at home, or in the community.  In this session, parents/guardians will learn about the scope and functions of AT, and actually handle many of the low-, mid-, and high-tech devices (from SERC's AT Corner in the SERC Library) that can enhance student learning.</p>
		<p>Participants will have the opportunity to share their questions and experiences with other families participating in the session. Parents will discover how they and the rest of the Planning and Placement Team can determine their child’s need for AT; how to choose AT devices and systems that would make a positive difference in their child’s learning; how to advocate for providing their child with an AT device or product he or she needs; the child’s legal right to AT equipment; and how AT can help a student achieve Secondary Transition goals and objectives.</p>
		<p>This session is a collaboration among SERC, the CT Parent Information and Resource Center (CT PIRC), and the Connecticut Parent Advocacy Center (CPAC).</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>5:30 p.m.</p>

		<h2>Assessment and Instruction for Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia: Exploring Collaborative Roles for Speech-language Pathologists</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">December 13, 2016</h3>
		<p>The expertise of many school professionals, including speech and language pathologists (SLPs), is needed by a student’s planning and placement team (PPT) to appropriately identify a Specific Learning Disability (SLD)/Dyslexia and to implement specially designed structured literacy interventions.</p>
		<p>In Part 1 of this roundtable colloquium, SLPs will access the resources of SERC’s library to examine speech and language assessment tools that inform the SLD/Dyslexia comprehensive evaluation process. In Part 2 of the series, SLPs will investigate research-based practices that support collaborative and consultative language-literacy interventions.</p>
		<p>SLPs participating in this professional learning opportunity will self-assess their collaborative pupil personnel team (PPT) role in the identification of SLD/Dyslexia; expand their repertoire of assessment tools; and support language-literacy instruction for students with SLD/Dyslexia via collaboration and consultation.</p>

		<h2>What Children Need to Support Social Emotional Competence in the Early Years</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">December 7, 2016</h3>
		<p>Healthy social emotional development is essential for young children to be successful in school.

		<p>In this introductory professional learning opportunity, participants will learn how to build the necessary elements of early learning settings in which children thrive. The session covers behavioral expectations and milestones for young children birth through age 5; the principles of behavior; the role of body language as a vehicle for understanding behavior; using culturally responsive practices to support social emotional development; and evidence-based tools to support children with challenging behaviors.</p>

		<h2>Assessment and Instruction for Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD)/Dyslexia: Exploring Collaborative Roles for Speech-language Pathologists</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">December 13, 2016</h3>
		<p>The expertise of many school professionals, including speech and language pathologists (SLPs), is needed by a student’s planning and placement team (PPT) to appropriately identify a Specific Learning Disability (SLD)/Dyslexia and to implement specially designed structured literacy interventions.</p>
		<p>In Part 1 of this roundtable colloquium, SLPs will access the resources of SERC’s library to examine speech and language assessment tools that inform the SLD/Dyslexia comprehensive evaluation process. In Part 2 of the series, SLPs will investigate research-based practices that support collaborative and consultative language-literacy interventions.</p>
		<p>SLPs participating in this professional learning opportunity will self-assess their collaborative pupil personnel team (PPT) role in the identification of SLD/Dyslexia; expand their repertoire of assessment tools; and support language-literacy instruction for students with SLD/Dyslexia via collaboration and consultation.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>4:00 p.m.</p>

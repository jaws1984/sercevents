		<h2>An Alternative to Restraint/Seclusion: Nonviolent Crisis Intervention</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">June 27, 2017</h3>
		<p>A new Connecticut law (P.A. 15-141) has significantly changed how or whether schools use restraint and seclusion. School staff need to know how to defuse escalating situations and address disruptive behaviors before they lead to a crisis.</p>
		<p>This two-day session covers Nonviolent Crisis Intervention, which emphasizes early intervention and nonphysical methods for managing disruptive behavior. Participants will also have the opportunity to learn and practice prevention and deceleration strategies, assessing level of risk and making appropriate decisions, managing behavioral risk using disengagement, debriefing after a crisis, and coping with their own fear and anxiety.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>
		<p><strong>Multi-day Event: </strong>6/27/2017, 6/28/2017</p>

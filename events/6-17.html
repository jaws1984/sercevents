The CoP is comprised of multiple stakeholder groups that have come together with a single focus: enhancing the transition of youth with disabilities to adult life. Come learn what we are all about, including the statewide Transition website and the wide range of Practice Groups that are working on innovative transition products, projects, and activities.

		<h2>CT Secondary Transition Community of Practice</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">June 9, 2016</h3>
		<p>Connecticut has created the CT Transition Community of Practice (CoP) to centralize all activities, resources, and initiatives related to secondary transition and to provide information and support to students, families, employers and professionals. The CoP is comprised of multiple stakeholder groups that have come together with a single focus: enhancing the transition of youth with disabilities to adult life. Come learn what we are all about, including the statewide Transition website and the wide range of Practice Groups that are working on innovative transition products, projects, and activities. See how your ideas fit into Connecticutâ€™s overall plans and help us plot our course for the coming year!</p>

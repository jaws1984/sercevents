		<h2>Building Relationships with Families for Student Success: Full-Day Training for School and District Staff</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">October 25, 2016</h3>
		<p><strong>Participants choose from one of two sessions:</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Session A: Home Visits that Bridge, Bond and Build Connections between Families and Schools</strong><br/>
		The Parent/Teacher Home Visit Project is nationally known for a proven model of home visits that end the cycle of blame between families and school staff by building trust and respect, instilling cultural competency, and increasing personal and professional capacity for all involved.  This session is designed for PK-12 schools and districts new to strategic and organized home visit efforts. This interactive session -- led by a team of parents and teachers who are directly involved in the work -- introduces the research, logistics, step-by-step guide, practice and skills of building effective relationships between families and teachers as co-educators of a child. It also addresses the barriers to communication and visits including language and cultural barriers, assumptions and fears about personal safety, mandated reporting concerns, etc.  At the end of the session, participants will be prepared to conduct home visits with families in their school. </p>

		<p><strong>Session B: Real Dads Forever: Fatherhood Strategies</strong><br/>
		This workshop will focus on a partnering approach for engaging fathers and family men in the lives of their children and families. Building on fathers’ unique strengths and perspectives, this session will take a deep look at the processes that are most successful. The goal is to create age-appropriate, gender-specific and culturally responsive fatherhood development strategies that enhance the emotional, physical, social and spiritual relationship between fathers and family men and their children. Participants will explore the barriers to partnering, unconscious biases, the skills and assets of dads, and their untapped potential -- ultimately discovering ways to build more connections with dads.</p>

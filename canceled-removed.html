		<h2>Building Relationships with Families for Student Success: Full-Day Training for School and District Staff</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">October 25, 2016</h3>
		<p><strong>Participants choose from one of two sessions:</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Session A: Home Visits that Bridge, Bond and Build Connections between Families and Schools</strong><br/>
		The Parent/Teacher Home Visit Project is nationally known for a proven model of home visits that end the cycle of blame between families and school staff by building trust and respect, instilling cultural competency, and increasing personal and professional capacity for all involved.  This session is designed for PK-12 schools and districts new to strategic and organized home visit efforts. This interactive session -- led by a team of parents and teachers who are directly involved in the work -- introduces the research, logistics, step-by-step guide, practice and skills of building effective relationships between families and teachers as co-educators of a child. It also addresses the barriers to communication and visits including language and cultural barriers, assumptions and fears about personal safety, mandated reporting concerns, etc.  At the end of the session, participants will be prepared to conduct home visits with families in their school. </p>

		<p><strong>Session B: Real Dads Forever: Fatherhood Strategies</strong><br/>
		This workshop will focus on a partnering approach for engaging fathers and family men in the lives of their children and families. Building on fathers’ unique strengths and perspectives, this session will take a deep look at the processes that are most successful. The goal is to create age-appropriate, gender-specific and culturally responsive fatherhood development strategies that enhance the emotional, physical, social and spiritual relationship between fathers and family men and their children. Participants will explore the barriers to partnering, unconscious biases, the skills and assets of dads, and their untapped potential -- ultimately discovering ways to build more connections with dads.</p>

		<h2>Wilson Fundations Workshops Level I: Grade 3</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">December 20, 2016</h3>
		<p>Wilson Fundations&reg; is a research-based program of systematic and explicit literacy instruction that supports the prevention of reading and spelling difficulties through “core” (Tier 1) instruction and the provision of early intervening services (Tier 2). Fundations Level 1 workshops are customized for general education K through 3 classroom instruction and progress monitoring.</p>
		<p>Each Fundations workshop addresses foundational reading and spelling skills aligned with the Connecticut Core Standards. Although Fundations includes comprehension strategies, it must be combined with a literature-based language arts program for an integrated and comprehensive approach to reading and spelling.</p>
		<p>Participants completing this professional learning opportunity will summarize the research base and component skills of structured reading instruction; create Level 1 Fundations learning plans; apply the methodology of structured reading instruction within classroom lessons; and progress monitor improvements in students’ reading and spelling achievement.</p>

		<p>You are more likely to encounter someone -- friend, family member, student, neighbor, or member of the community -- in an emotional or mental health crisis than someone having a heart attack. Mental Health First Aid teaches a 5-step action plan to offer initial help to young people showing signs of a mental illness or in a crisis, and connect them with the appropriate professional, peer, social, or self-help care. </p>
		<p>This course is intended for teachers, support staff, paraeducators, coaches, and other school employees who have frequent contact with youth. Participants will have time to action plan to strategize a procedure for intervening with identified students.</p>

		<h2>Differentiate Your Math Instruction (6-12)</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">March 29, 2017</h3>
		<p>Today’s increasingly diverse math classrooms call for increased focus on differentiated instruction. At its core, differentiated instruction simply involves teachers reacting responsively to learners’ differences. Research has shown various approaches to be effective in providing differentiation.</p>
		<p>In this session, participants will learn strategies for grouping, providing learning activities, assessing, and offering student choice. On Day Two, participants will share their own classroom differentiation experiences and provide feedback to one another.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>
		<p><strong>Multi-day Event: </strong>3/29/2017, 5/10/2017</p>

		<h2>Middle School Math: Making Meaning with Manipulatives</h2>
		<h3 class="mobile">April 28, 2017</h3>
		<p>Elementary math classes often incorporate manipulatives to help students extend their math reasoning from concrete to abstract.  Too often, this practice is abandoned in the higher grades.  Yet the use of manipulatives by learners of all ages is an effective way to increase conceptual understanding of math concepts, as called for by the Connecticut Core Standards (CCS) for Math.  Manipulatives can be especially useful for English learners, struggling math learners, and any student who may be disengaged.</p>
	    <p>In this full-day session, middle school educators will be introduced to fraction bars and algebra tiles.  Participants will practice using these manipulatives and develop strategies to incorporate them into lessons aligned with the CCS.</p>
		<p><strong>Time: </strong>9:00 a.m.</p>
